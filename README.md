# hake-CEATTLE
Implementation of the CEATTLE model for Pacific hake, using the [Rceattle pacakge by Grant Adams](https://github.com/grantdadams/Rceattle). The first iteration of this model, focused on the impacts of cannibalism on hake population dynamics, [was published in the ICES Journal of Marine Science](https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/advance-article/doi/10.1093/icesjms/fsae064/7675094).

The code for that publication is primarily in the [`run_ceattle.R`](https://github.com/sowasser/hake-CEATTLE/blob/main/R/run_ceattle.R) and [`ceattle_cannibalism.R`](https://github.com/sowasser/hake-CEATTLE/blob/main/R/ceattle_cannibalism.R), with additional code for generating manuscript plots in [`ceattle_HCRcomp.R`](https://github.com/sowasser/hake-CEATTLE/blob/main/R/ceattle_HCRcomp.R) and [`profile_Rceattle.R`](https://github.com/sowasser/hake-CEATTLE/blob/main/R/profile_Rceattle.R). Code for data wrangling and intermediate data products are in the data folder.

Further development of the model, such as testing new configurations and updating the model to match the most recent hake assessment, is conducted in [`ceattle_testing.R`](https://github.com/sowasser/hake-CEATTLE/blob/main/R/ceattle_testing.R).
